To be or not to be that is the question?

Where there is nobler in the  mind to suffer the slings arrows of outrageous fortune

pass the salt please!

I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows.
I am who I am from my head to my toes.
I tend to get loud when speaking my mind.
Even a little crazy some of the time.

I want to go to the beach
